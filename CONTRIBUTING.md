## Pull Request Process

If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go ahead. We 
use a typical git workflow to make it happen.

1. Fork this conformance suite repository.
2. Create a feature or hotfix branch make changes and push code. 
3. Open a Pull Request against this repo.
4. A member of the RefApps team will review your change and approve or comment 
on it in due course.

### Notes:

We use a typical git workflow. Feature branches should start `feature/` and `hotfix/`.  
Please make sure that you **ALWAYS** create pull requests for the develop branch.
Pull requests to the master branch will be closed. The only exception to this is hotfix 
branches which fix critical bugs on the existing release.
