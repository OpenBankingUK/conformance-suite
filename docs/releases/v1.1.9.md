## Features/Fixes Overview

Below you will find a list of the main features in this release.

### Support kid/trust anchor using EIDAS Certificates

Support for eIDAS certificates in JWS-SIgnature generation for payments with the addition of a configurable UI option to enter a trust anchor/kid if not using the Open Banking Directory. 

By default this flag is *unchecked* and the existing JWS signature implementation is used. When this flag is checked, "Signing Key ID (kid)" and "Signature Trust Anchor" are presented as free text felids.

### Enabled Docker Content Trust Framework

Added support for Docker Content Trust *(DCT)*. Docker Content Trust (DCT) ensures that all content is securely received and verified. Open Banking cryptographically signs the images upon completion of a satisfactory image check, so that implementers can verify and trust certified content.

Open Banking now signs images with the `$ docker trust command`. Which is built on top of the Notary cli. Notary is a tool for publishing and managing trusted collections of content. Publishers can digitally sign collections and consumers can verify integrity and origin of content.

Remote trust data for a tag or a repository can be viewed by the `$ docker trust` inspect command

For example:

    $ docker trust inspect --pretty docker.io/openbanking/conformance-suite:v1.1.9

**`DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` is highly recommended** Once DCT is enabled remote trust is checked on every pull request. If no trust data for a tag is found you will be presented with an error.

    export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 
    docker pull openbanking/conformance-suite:TAG
    Error: remote trust data does not exist for docker.io/openbanking/conformance-suite: notary.docker.io does not have trust data for docker.io/openbanking/conformance-suite

### Better validation of error codes against the OBIE API specifications

Added new asserts to better validate error codes against the OBIE API specifications.

New asserts:

* OB3IPAssertUnexpectedErrorOBErrorCode
* OB3IPAssertHeaderMissingOBErrorCode
* OB3IPAssertHeaderInvalidOBErrorCode
* OB3IPAssertResourceInvalidConsentStatusOBErrorCode

### Fixed incorrect scope parameter for Authentication Code grant type

Fixed the Conformance Suite appending the "scope" parameter on "Authentication Code" grant type. The underlying OAUTH 2 spec does not list scope as a valid parameter for this grant type and it should be removed. 4.1.3 of RFC6749. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3

* Reported by Chris Marquis, Sainsburys Bank.
* [Pull Request](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/373).
* [Bug](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/browse/OBSD-8964)


### Fixed X-Fapi-Interaction-Id 36 characters long

Some Test Cases (e.g. OB-301-ACC-100700) on the request were sending the x-fapi-interaction-id with a 40 character long UUID. According to the RFC 4122 standard the field should be 36 characters long.

Other features/fixes made

* Added total failures in exported report. Extends the outputted reporting.json by added a new field called fails which Calculates total failures across the whole report, accumulated for each specification. [Pull Request](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/370).
* Fixed OBActiveCurrencyAndAmount_SimpleType: to not add pad value by default. [Pull Request](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/376).
