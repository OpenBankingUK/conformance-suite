## Features/Fixes Overview

Below you will find a list of the main features in this release.

### Support for dynamically allocated resourceIDs for accounts API

Support for dynamically allocated resource ids in accounts and transactions API. A call to `/accounts` will retrieve the account numbers, the first in the list is used.

For each accounts access_token, there will be a call to `/accounts`, and potentially a set of unique account ids for that specific access token. This implies that without at least for dynamic resource allocation to work the permissions `readAccountsBasic` or `readAccountsDetail` are required to make the call to `/accounts` (plus `readTransactionsCredits` or `readTransactionsDebits`)

By default the dynamic resource allocation functionality is **disabled**. To enable the functionally, pass in the following environment variable `DYNRES=TRUE`

This is a new feature, and as such will rely on feedback from ASPSPs to align with variations in Dynamic Resource Allocation implementations.
