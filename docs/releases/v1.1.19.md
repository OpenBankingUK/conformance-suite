## Features/Fixes Overview

Below you will find a list of the main features in this release.

### Conditional properties

For Standing orders and any other payment requests some ASPSPs mandate conditional properties, such as 'Reference' or 'CreditorAccount. SecondaryIdentification' in the request. The conformance tool has introduced a new feature that allows the collection and use of conditional properties given a discovery file.

The Discovery specification has been updated to support conditional properties, see Discovery Specification v0.4.0. Discovery templates using version 0.3.0 or below will continue to operate, but "conditional property" processing is ignored for these versions.

Usage:

1. The your discovery file update your `discoveryVersion` to `v0.4.0` to make use of conditional properties.

2. Add your conditional properties to each endpoint, for example:

```
    "conditionalProperties": [{
                "schema": "OBWriteDataDomesticConsentResponse1",
                "property": "Charges",
                "path": "Data.Charges"
            }]
```

3. Each conditional property will be presented in the configuration screen:
