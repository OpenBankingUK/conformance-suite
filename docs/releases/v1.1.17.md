## Features/Fixes Overview

Below you will find a list of the main features in this release.

### Disabled JSON Web Signatures (JWS) by default in line with Waiver 007

In support of [Waiver 007](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/1112670669/W007), OBIE must update the conformance harness to not generate or validate the message signature during the period of the waiver.

Tool Usage: environment variable usage from `DISABLE_JWS=TRUE` to `ENABLE_JWS=TRUE` if JWS needs to be enabled for testing.

### Support for a new user agent string

Added support a user agent that uses the `orgid` and `software statementid` from the transport certificate at the end of the user agent string, if the certificate has an orgid and software statement id. An example of the resulting user agent string is:

OpenBankingFCS/v1.1.16/0015800001041RbAAI/REfZKo7zN2IeE0X2RFGTb4

If the transport certificate doesn�t have a dn in the correct format, the orgid and ssid are skipped.
