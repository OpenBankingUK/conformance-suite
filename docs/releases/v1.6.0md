### New Support for the OBIE 3.1.6 Read/Write Specifications

This release adds support for the 3.1.6 0BIE Read/Write specifications this includes updated swagger and response validation.

This update provides backwards compatibility with previous versions of the specification (3.1.5, 3.1.4 ,3.1.3, 3.1.2, 3.1.1 and 3.1.0).

## How to use

Usage is predicated on your discovery endpoints i.e. /open-banking/v3.1/pisp/domestic-payments and version value in your Discovery file. For example:

```
    {
            "apiSpecification": {
            "name": "Account and Transaction API Specification",
            "url": "https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.6/profiles/account-and-transaction-api-profile.html",
            "version": "v3.1.6",
            "schemaVersion": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBankingUK/read-write-api-specs/v3.1.6/dist/swagger/account-info-swagger.json",
            "manifest": "file://manifests/ob_3.1_accounts_transactions_fca.json"
    }

```

No changes are requied in your discovery file if you're using old versions of the specifications.

### New Test Case Versioning

New mechanism provides a powerful yet easily maintainable way of managing multiple version dependencies for the each of the tools testcases.

The api versioning uses semantic versioning (https://semver.org) - and is implemented in Go using the https://github.com/blang/semver library.

With each testcase there is json field  'apiVersion'

```
    {
    "id":"OB-301-ACC-TESTXXX",
    "apiVersion":"",
            ...
    }
```

By default the 'apiVersion' field is empty/absent - when means that the testcase applies to all supported versions of the APIs.

We use the 'ranges' feature of the semver library as the apiVersion which allows for example the following testcase version specifiers.

* "apiVersion": ">=3.1.4"
* "apiVersion": ">=3.1.0 <=3.1.3"
* "apiVersion": "3.1.4, 3.1.6, 3.1.7, 4.0.1"
* "apiVersion": ">=3.1.4, <=3.1.6"
* "apiVersion": "3.1.6"

The end result is that we have one testcase json file for each api (accounts,payments,cbpii), and that file contains all the tests for all versions of that API. 

The API version to be used for the tests is determined by the "version" tag of the "apiSpecification" section of the discovery file.
