## Features/Fixes Overview

This release provides backwards compatibility with previous versions of the Open Banking Read/Write Data API Specification *(3.1.5,3.1.3, 3.1.2, 3.1.1 and 3.1.0)*. 

Below you will find a list of the main features in this release.

### New Self-certification Form 

The self-certification form is a physical document (.doc) that ASPSPs are required to complete before they can certify with OBIE. This update digitally adds fields to the exported JSON and therefore negates the need for ASPSPs to complete the existing self-certification form in the future. [PR](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/537)

### New UI Input Support for SSA & KID when using EIDAS certs

This update adds two new configuration options when 'use EIDAS certs' checkbox is clicked. The two input screens collect the software statement id and the signing kid to be used with the supplied Eidas certifications (this includes OB-Wacs and OB-Seals) [PR](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/534)


### Handling of 403 Error Body Assertions

This update fixes reports of test failures for valid 403 status code responses when an error response body is not present. It also includes assertions for account transactions and additional tests. [PR](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/535)
