## Features/Fixes Overview

This release provides backwards compatibility with previous versions of the Open Banking Read/Write Data API Specification *(3.1.5,3.1.3, 3.1.2, 3.1.1 and 3.1.0)*. 

Below you will find a list of the main features in this release.

### JWS signature checking

The OBIE R/W API specification (in v3.0, 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.1.2 and 3.1.3) require both TPPs and ASPSPs to sign all payment messages *(JSON Web Signatures JWS)*. 

Non-repudiation requirements are met through the use of a number of extensions including [RFC 7797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797).

Checking is determined by the version of the payment initiation api used in your discovery file `apiSpecification->version`.

Version 3.1.3 and previous versions:

* `x-jws-signature` header sent in requests for payments POST requests (b64=false)
* Validation of x-jws-signature headers for payment Responses (b64=false)

Version v3.1.4 and subsequent versions:

* `x-jws-signature` header send in requests for payments POST requests (b64=true)
* Validation of `x-jws-signature` headers for payment responses (b64=true)

### Disabling of JWS signature checking

The tool adds a new command-line flag - `JWS_DISABLE=TRUE` that is used when starting the Docker container. This new flag will disabled the sending of `x-jws-signature` headers and the validation of `x-jws-signature` responses.

**This flag is to be used for testing purposes only**. OBIE will NOT accept ASPSP/TSP certifications for PIS where signature checking is disabled.

### Report export updates.

This update adds the `x-jws_signature` status in the exported report file. Status can be `true`, `false` or disabled, reflecting the b64 flag status.

### How to use

No changes to your discovery file is required. Response signatures are validated by extracting the `keyID` (kid) from the signature header, then retrieving the corresponding Public Key from the JWKS_URL defined in the `well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint.

JWT header claims are also validated for each `x-jws-signature` response.

### Other updates

* HTTP Status Code is recorded for each test in the report file.
* Removed `data.charges` in condional properties [PR](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/526)
