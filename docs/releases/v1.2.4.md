## Features/Fixes Overview

Below you will find a list of the main features in this release.

### Allow supplementation data input

This change allows the supplementary data fields to be populated. Supplementary data is a freeform field which makes json validation challenging.

Example discovery file fragment:

```
    {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/international-payment-consents",
        "conditionalProperties": [
            {
            "schema": "OBSupplementaryData1",
            "name": "Purpose",
            "path": "Data.Initiation.SupplementaryData"
            }
        ]
    }
```

The convention introduced here is that the actual path of the data within the request body is made up of two parts.

The first part is the path - eg. `Data.Initiation.SupplementaryData`

The second part is the name: `Purpose`

This creates a supplementary data element of `Data.Initiation.SupplementaryData.Purpose`

An example of the resulting json body for international payments consents is:

```
    {
    "Data": {
        "Initiation": {
            "SupplementaryData": {
                "Purpose": "MySupplementaryData"
            },
            "CreditorAccount": {
                "Identification": "70000170000002",
                "Name": "Mr. Roberto Rastapopoulos & Ivan Sakharine & mits",
                "SchemeName": "UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber"
            },
            "CurrencyOfTransfer": "USD",
            "EndToEndIdentification": "e2e-internat-pay",
            "InstructedAmount": {
                "Amount": "1.00",
                "Currency": "GBP"
            },
            "InstructionIdentification": "a2b4d153870e44608fff5065a5428ef5"
        }
    },
    "Risk": {}
    }
```

### Hotfix expirationDateTime

A number of ASPSPs had reported payloads which consists of "ExpirationDateTime": "2020-01-01T00:00:00+01:00". This date was no longer valid and was blocking testing for CBPII.

### Add AssertHeaderMissing when no token for Accounts

For negative tests that obmit an access token in the request we now check the format of the response body message in all relevant tests, rather than just in `OB-301-BEN-102000`.

## Other notable features/fixes made

* Fixed a TLS test that was tied to go1.12 - using the 1.12 default tls version number, which changed from TLS1.2 to TLS1.3 for go 1.13 [Pull Request](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/506)
* Added a flag that disables tls version checking for people in development environment. Tls version checking needs to be enabled for a certification submission. [Pull Request](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/pull-requests/505)
