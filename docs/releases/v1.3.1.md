## Features/Fixes Overview

Below you will find a list of the main features in this release.


### New Support for the OBIE 3.1.3 Read/Write Specifications

This release adds support for the 3.1.3 0BIE Read/Write specifications and fixes an issue where the new swaggers files are not correctly copied into the docker image directories.

This update provides backwards compatibility with previous versions of the specification *(3.1.2, 3.1.1 and 3.1.0)*.

### How to use

Usage is predicated on your discovery endpoints i.e. `/open-banking/v3.1/pisp/domestic-payments` and `version` value in your Discovery file. For example:


        "apiSpecification": {
          "name": "Payment Initiation API",
          "version": "v3.1.3",

No changes are requied in your discovery file if you're using old versions of the specifications.
